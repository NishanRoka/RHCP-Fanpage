I have created a website for Red Hot Chilli Peppers (American band). The website consists of three pages: a home page through which people can buy tickets to arbitrary concerts, a store page where fans can buy albums merchandise, an about page which contains the description of the band. I have put more effort on store page which reflects an ecommerce platform through which fans can buy their favourite albums or merchs of their desired amount. Fans can add the item to the cart, set the quantity and checkout. Since, the user interface is simple and friendly, users can easily interact with the page smoothly and without any trouble.
